Airgead Banking wants a screen to display with the following information:

• Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of your investment (a positive real number) 
• Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment each month (a positive real number)
• Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)
• Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow 
• A way to see the data (for example: “Press any key to continue…”)
