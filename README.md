# Annual-Compound-Interest-Calculator
CS210_Project2

Airgead Banking wants a screen to display with the following information:

• Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of your investment (a positive real number) <br>
• Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment each month (a positive real number)<br>
• Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)<br>
• Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow <br>
• A way to see the data (for example: “Press any key to continue…”)<br>


When the user continues, the console should display two static reports. One should show the <br>
year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The <br>
second should show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly <br>
deposit value that was input by the user ($50.00 in this example). The following is an example of <br>
what your interface might look like. It is in no way representative of what it must look like. Be <br>
creative and keep the user experience in mind when designing your solution<br>
