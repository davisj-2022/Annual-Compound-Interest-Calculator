• Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment each month (a positive real number)<br>
• Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)<br>
• Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow <br>
• A way to see the data (for example: “Press any key to continue…”)<br>
